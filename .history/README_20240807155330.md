# Virtual DOM Framework

This is a lightweight Virtual DOM framework that supports diffing and patching the DOM efficiently. It includes a simple state management system and routing capabilities.

## Features

- **Virtual DOM:** Efficiently update the DOM by comparing the current state with the previous state and applying only the necessary changes.
- **Centralized Event Handling:** Delegate event handling to a central event listener for better performance and maintainability.
- **State Management:** Simple store implementation to manage the application state.
- **Routing:** Basic routing functionality to handle hash-based URL changes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a modern web browser that supports ES6 features.

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/virtual-dom-framework.git

## Virtual DOM Diffing and Patching
The framework compares the new virtual DOM tree with the old one and applies only the necessary changes to the real DOM.

import { diff, patch } from './src/dom.js';


const rootElement = document.getElementById('app');
const oldVNode = createElement('div', {}, 'Old Content');
const newVNode = createElement('div', {}, 'New Content');

Compute the differences and patch the DOM
const patches = diff(oldVNode, newVNode);
patch(rootElement, patches);



## Event Handling
Event handlers are delegated to a central event listener. Add event handlers as attributes when creating virtual DOM elements.
